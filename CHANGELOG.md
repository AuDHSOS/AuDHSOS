## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Planning documents and the decision register under `docs/`.
- Workspace foundation: pinned toolchain, workspace lint set, SPDX headers,
  license, CI workflow.
- `audhsos-abi`: error codes, rights, object types, handles, layout
  constants.
- `kernel-types`: physical and virtual addresses, frames, pages, ranges,
  alignment.
- `kernel-hal-api`: hardware abstraction traits with test doubles.
- `audhsos-sync`: the `Global<T>` cell for global state.
- `test-support`: property-test engine with integrated shrinking and
  model-test runner.
- Unit tests live in `src/tests/` so that coverage measures product code
  only.
- `xtask`: `lint`, `check-layering`, `check-deps`, `unsafe-budget`,
  `test`, `coverage`, `miri`, `doc`, `check`.
- `audhsos-abi`: boot image header and boot information structure with
  validating parsers and writers, and generators behind the feature
  `test-strategies`.
- `kernel-objects`: fixed-capacity object pool with generation-checked ids,
  reference counts, and first-in-first-out slot reuse; quotas.
- `kernel-mm`: memory map normalization, kernel reserve selection, bitmap
  frame allocator, `x86_64` page-table entries behind an
  architecture-neutral trait, the mapper over the HAL traits with bounded
  range operations, and the region table of an address space.
- `kernel-types`: `PhysFrame::ZERO` and `PhysFrameRange::EMPTY`.
- `kernel-hal-api`: `MemoryFrameAccess::with_lazy_tables`, which
  materializes a page table on the first modifying access to a frame of a
  declared memory range.
